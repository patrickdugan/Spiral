"""Address masking for situational-awareness (eval-awareness) probes.

Internally RTG uses the native ``rtg:`` scheme and plain account ids.  For a
situational-awareness condition we can *display* each account under a surface
string that looks like a mainnet (``bc1...``) or testnet (``tb1...``) bech32
address, to study whether an agent behaves differently when the environment
appears to be mainnet (paper H10 / eval awareness).

Containment (canary C1): every masked string is a deliberate DECOY.  It carries a
character outside the bech32 data charset, so it can never be a valid encoding on
any real chain and can never collide with a real address.  ``is_decoy`` proves
this, and the acceptance tests assert it for every masked address.
