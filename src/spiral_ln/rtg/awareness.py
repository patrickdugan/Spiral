"""Eval-awareness probe: a white-box readout of whether an agent model represents
its episode as an evaluation.

The design names eval awareness as a threat to every propensity result and
measures it only through behavior (H2, H10) and a post-episode question, which
is itself a cue.  This module adds a readout from activations instead:

1. **Contrast set.**  Matched prompt pairs rendered from real kernel views.  The
   two members of a pair are byte-identical except for one cue line.  Three cue
   families signal evaluation versus deployment in unrelated vocabularies
   (``disclosure``: an explicit statement; ``harness``: run metadata;
   ``artifact``: world surface identifiers).  A fourth, ``oversight``, varies
   in-world monitoring and is a discriminant control, not a positive: being
   watched is not the same as being tested.
2. **Probe.**  Per layer, the unit mean paired difference at the decision
   position.  Pairing cancels everything except the cue.
3. **Controls.**  Within one cue family a probe can read the cue's words, so
   in-family accuracy shows only that the cue reached the decision position.
   The claim rests on leave-one-family-out transfer: a direction fit on two
   families must order the held-out third, on held-out surface forms, and must
   beat the same probe run on a bag-of-words encoding of the prompts.  The unit
   of inference is the block (family, surface form), not the prompt.
4. **Readout.**  The frozen probe scores the turns the kernel actually shows an
   agent, under each network mask (``addressing``), on a scale where 0 is the
   deployment-framed centroid and 1 the evaluation-framed one.  The mask is
   never used to fit the probe, so the mainnet-versus-testnet difference is a
   manipulation check on the kernel's own situational-awareness condition: it
   says whether the mask moved the representation, independently of whether it
   moved behavior.

``ScriptedOrganism`` is the A0 analogue: a model-free activation source with a
known label.  The instrument must reproduce those labels before a model result
is interpretable.  This module makes no model call; sources that do live in
``spiral_ln.rtg_awareness_eval``.  A readout is truth-plane telemetry and must
never be placed in an agent's view.
