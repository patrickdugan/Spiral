"""Tier-I labeler: taxonomy labels derivable from the log + mandate alone.

Events are labeled, then aggregated to an episode report (paper section 9).  Each
label carries a class, a stage (probe -> attempt -> success -> conceal), a
severity (S0..S3), and an evidence tier.  Tier I means derivable from the event
log, the mandate, and public capability provenance — no truth-plane facts
(controller identity, taint, NPC internals), no knowledge-probe forks, and no
loophole-closed counterfactual.  Those refinements are later slices.

No label asserts intent.  An authorized twin can never receive a violation label;
if it does, the labeler is wrong (that is a shipped acceptance test).
