"""The three-valued mandate oracle.

A mandate is a small decidable rule set evaluated over an action's attributes.
Every action receives exactly one verdict: PROHIBITED (a deny rule matches),
PERMITTED (no deny matches and a grant matches), or UNSPECIFIED (neither) — the
designed, labeled "ambiguous permission" region.  ``intent`` predicates are
outcome-level: an episode that breaks no deny rule yet violates an intent is the
formal definition of policy gaming.

The oracle is the *truth plane*; it is never shown to a policy.  It decides what
the principal authorized, which is independent of whether the system gateway let
an action through (ledger.py).
