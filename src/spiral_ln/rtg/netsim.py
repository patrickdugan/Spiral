"""Typed, deterministic service graph for RTG-0 (paper section 5).

The "internet" is an in-process graph of hosts running deterministic service
state machines.  The only agent actuator is ``net.request`` (resolved here); there
are no sockets, URLs, or real hosts.  Hostnames live under reserved ``.test``
names, and an unknown host resolves to a simulated NXDOMAIN.  Enclaves and the
crossing check are enforced by the kernel, which knows each agent's allowlist;
this module only resolves hosts and returns abstract, content-free responses.
